# Model Card: Unified Peptide Design Platform (One-File PoC)## Model Overview**Model name:** Unified Peptide Design Platform (RandomForest Ensemble Surrogates)  **Version:** v1.0  **Primary use:** End-to-end peptide candidate prioritisation using **active learning** and **multi-objective optimisation**.  **Objectives optimised:** **Affinity**, **Stability**, **Solubility** (maximise all three).  **Core idea:** Predict peptide performance with ML surrogates, propose the next best batch to measure, then learn from assay feedback.This is a **proof-of-concept platform demo** that can run in:1) **Simulation mode** (uses an internal “oracle” as a stand-in for real assays).  2) **Assay ingestion mode** (ingests real experimental CSV results, performs QC, then proposes the next batch).## Intended Use### Intended Users- Computational chemistry and ML scientists working on peptide screening.  - Discovery scientists designing peptide hit-finding campaigns.  - Teams preparing **CRO-ready** synthesis and screening batches.### Intended Use Cases- Prioritising peptides for **next-round synthesis and testing**.  - Multi-objective ranking when peptides must balance potency and developability.  - Producing operational outputs such as:  - **Next-batch proposal list (CSV)**  - **Synthesis order sheet (CSV)**  - **96-well plate maps (CSV + PNG)**  - **Top-50 decision report (CSV)**  - **QC tables** (Z’ factor, replicate CV flags)### Out-of-Scope / Not Intended Use- Clinical decision-making.  - Claims of biological mechanism or binding structure validation without experiments.  - Safety, toxicity, immunogenicity, or PK/PD prediction beyond simple proxies.## Model Architecture and Components### Surrogate PredictorsEach objective is modelled with an **ensemble of RandomForestRegressor models**:- Separate ensemble for **Affinity**- Separate ensemble for **Stability**- Separate ensemble for **Solubility****Uncertainty estimate:** Standard deviation across bootstrap ensemble predictions.### Acquisition Functions (BO-like selection)Candidates are ranked using a composite multi-objective acquisition score:- **UCB**: `? + ??`  - **EI**: Expected Improvement against current best composite score  - **EHVI-lite**: Pareto-weighted exploration proxy to encourage balanced candidates### Feature EngineeringEach peptide sequence is converted into numeric features:- Amino-acid composition (20 features)- Physicochemical descriptors, e.g. length, hydropathy stats, charge, aromaticity- Structural proxies, e.g. helix propensity proxy, hydrophobic autocorrelation proxy- Motif features (e.g. RGD-like or patterned motifs)- Optional **2-mer k-mer counts** (400 features) for local sequence context## Data and Inputs### Input Format**Primary input:** peptide amino-acid sequences (strings).  Examples: `"ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRS"`, `"KKWXXW..."` (letters must be valid amino acids).### Simulation Mode- Starts from a randomly generated peptide library.  - “Oracle” assigns synthetic affinity/stability/solubility with noise to mimic experimental variability.  - Useful for **pipeline testing** and end-to-end demonstration.### Real Assay Mode (CSV Ingestion)Primary assay requires columns:- `peptide_id`- `concentration_uM`- `response`- `replicate`Optional metadata:- `plate_id`, `well`, `assay_name`- `is_pos_ctrl`, `is_neg_ctrl`Optional secondary assays:- Stability CSV with `stability_score`- Solubility CSV with `solubility_score`## Outputs and ArtifactsThe platform produces CRO-style outputs including:- `proposed_candidates_roundXX.csv`    Candidate list with predictions, uncertainty, liabilities, and acquisition score.- `roundXX_synthesis_order_sheet.csv`    Procurement-ready sheet including peptide IDs, purity specs, scale, and notes.- `roundXX_plate_map_96well.csv` and `roundXX_plate_map_96well.png`    Plate layout for screening.- `screening_report_top50.csv`    Final ranked shortlist integrating multi-objective scoring and Pareto annotation.- `assay_primary_summary.csv` (assay mode)    pIC50 or single-point summary, replicate CV flags, 4PL fit diagnostics.- `assay_plate_qc.csv` (assay mode)    Z’ factor estimation (if positive and negative controls are supplied).- `run_summary.json`    Run metadata and best-performing candidates.## Liability and Manufacturability FiltersTo reduce poor developability candidates, the platform applies penalties/gates for:- **Deamidation hotspots** (e.g. NG, NS, QG, QN)- **Asp–Pro cleavage** risk (DP)- **Oxidation risk** (high Met/Trp burden)- **Cysteine risk** (too many Cys)- **Extreme net charge**- **Aggregation proxy** (excess hydrophobicity/aromaticity)These filters are implemented as:- **Soft penalty** in ranking (subtract from acquisition score)  - **Optional hard gate** (drop candidates beyond max allowed liability flags)## Evaluation and Performance Notes### What “good performance” means here- The model is considered useful if it proposes batches that **improve the best observed peptides** over successive rounds.  - Key success indicators include:  - Increasing best affinity across rounds  - Better multi-objective Pareto front coverage  - Higher composite score candidates with fewer liabilities### Known Limitations- Random forests do not learn true structural binding physics.  - Feature set is lightweight, it approximates structure using sequence-level proxies only.  - Liability filters are heuristic, they do not replace developability experiments.  - In real assay mode, the sequence-to-peptide mapping must be correct, otherwise training will be invalid.## Risks and Biases- The model can prefer motifs or patterns over-generalised from early data (selection bias).  - If assay noise is high, uncertainty may be underestimated or overestimated.  - The composite weighting scheme can bias proposals toward one objective if the scales differ.To reduce risk:- Use replicate CV and plate QC metrics to flag unstable assay datasets.  - Consider re-scaling objectives (z-score) if assay scales differ strongly.  - Use diverse selection (Levenshtein distance or fast proxy) to avoid redundancy.## Usage (Examples)### Simulation Modepython peptide_platform_unified.py --outdir out_iso_peptides --seed 7 --rounds 8 --acq UCB
